## Customization

### Adding New Sections
To add new resume sections (e.g., Certifications, Projects):

1. Add the HTML form elements in `index.html`
2. Update the CSS styling in `style.css`
3. Modify the JavaScript in `script.js` to handle the new data
4. Update the `renderPreview()` method to display the new section

### Styling Changes
- Modify `style.css` to change colors, fonts, and layout
- The resume preview uses a different font family (Georgia) for a professional look
- Form elements use Bootstrap classes for consistent styling

- Multiple pages are automatically created for longer resumes
- The scale factor (2x) ensures high-quality output
